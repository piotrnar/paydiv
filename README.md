paydiv

Pay dividends functionality for #assets-otc

Before using the script edit config.php to set the required info accordingly.

Then, to run the script, just execute:
> php paydiv.php

It was tested on Windows and Ubuntu, but there is no reason why it would not
work on any other system.

Just make sure that your shell would recognize the following commands:
> php
> gpg
> tar
> rm
> mkdir
